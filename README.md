# BoricaIntegration
Integration with BORICA payment system. BORICA is a Bulgarian payment operator.

I have had some problems with integrating Borica payment system into ASP.NET MVC project. It is very easy to communicate with Borica's system using PHP and OpenSSL but not so straightforward in C#. Although there is OpenSSL implementation for .NET, I don't like it. So I'm planning to create NuGET package for integration of Borica payment system with .NET application.

This is still in development and is not a working example.
